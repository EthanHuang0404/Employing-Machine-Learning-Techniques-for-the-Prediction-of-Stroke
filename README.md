## Introduction
Dizziness or vertigo is a common complaint in emergency departments. After ruling out general conditions like anemia, emergency physicians must distinguish between benign peripheral vestibular disorders and serious central nervous system issues, notably strokes. In the U.S., around 4.4 million emergency visits yearly are for dizziness or vertigo, with 34% due to benign vestibular disorders and 3-5% from strokes, particularly in the brainstem or cerebellum.

Differentiating strokes in such cases is challenging. Strokes causing dizziness often have small lesions in the brainstem or cerebellum, leaving major pathways unaffected. This means routine neurological tests may seem normal, and typical stroke symptoms like facial droop or limb weakness might not be present. Studies show that strokes with initial vestibular symptoms are missed in 35% of emergency cases, compared to 4% for strokes with unilateral motor weakness. Even skilled neurologists can miss these subtle signs, like Hornerâ€™s syndrome or hoarseness, as they require specific examination techniques not commonly used in emergency settings.
